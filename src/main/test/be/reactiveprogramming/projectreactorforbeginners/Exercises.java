   * to be able to run them easily. These tests will try to verify your results as well as possible through the StepVerifier, but often you'll also have to check manually if they worked as inspected.

   * Of course you can work in groups, this can certainly lead to interesting debate throughout the exercises.

  /**
   * TODO 01 READ: The Flux is one of the most basic Publishers in Project Reactor, but one of the most versatile at the same time. It's a part of a pipeline where values will stream through in a
   * Reactive way. It will emit elements until it ends with an error or completes. Operations can be added to them which will "extend" the pipeline, and enables for more endpoints to be added. Most of the
   * time the first part of the pipeline will be on the asynchronous boundaries of the application, where values can be supplied to it in a non-blocking manner through Reactive drivers interfacing
   * with external systems.
   *
   * For simplicity's sake however, these exercises will be created with some basic values that will be provided in the Flux itself. Most of the exercises will have a StepVerifier at the end, which will
   * verify the results of your created Reactive pipelines. In other exercises, a description will tell you what you should expect to see at the end of the exercise. These exercises require you to use
   * a subscribe method at the end of your Reactive pipeline to activate it. This will work in a non-blocking wau, however, so you'll be required to use the sleep() method underneath this text to make
   * sure the thread doesn't stop by itself.
